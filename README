Quantitative analysis of gene expression variance.

A set of scripts used to partition gene count variance to additive and non-additive variance.

Summary of the included scripts:

allele_frequencies.R
Script to estimate the difference of the estimated allele frequencies between original and hybrid populations. Requires vcf files of SNPs within genes in the original populations only.

cluster_MCMCv2.R
Script to partition the gene count variance to additive, non-additive variance. The analysis is performed iteratively via a linux terminal.

cluster_MCMCvPerm.R
Script to permute the gene identity and then partition the gene count variance to additive, non-additive variance. The analysis is performed iteratively via a linux terminal.

fpkm_counts.R
Estimate the FPKM per gene and then summarize for the individuals.

geneGWAS_plots.R
GWAS for the counts of each gene based on EMMA. The analysis is performed iteratively.

GeneOntology.R
Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis for additive and non-additive variance, including permutation of gene identity for estimating a p value threshold.

genetic_distance.py
Script for estimating the genetic distance between lines. It is based on vcf files.

summarize_animal_model_results.r
Summary and filtering of the files produced by cluster_MCMCv2.r and cluster_MCMCvPerm.R.
